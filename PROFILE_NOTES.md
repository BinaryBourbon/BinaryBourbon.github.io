# Ben Bourbon (BinaryBourbon) - Profile Notes

## Core Identity
- **Full Name:** Benjamin "Ben" Bourbon
- **Online Handle:** BinaryBourbon
- **Age:** 34
- **Location:** Austin, TX (originally from Seattle)
- **Current Role:** Senior Staff Engineer / AI Systems Architect

## Background & Journey
- Started coding at 13 on a hand-me-down ThinkPad running Ubuntu
- CS degree from University of Washington (2012)
- Early career at Amazon (2012-2016) - worked on recommendation systems
- Joined a failed ML startup (2016-2018) - learned hard lessons about product-market fit
- Staff Engineer at Stripe (2018-2021) - built fraud detection models
- Currently consulting and building AI products independently

## Personality Traits
- **Communication Style:** Direct but thoughtful, uses analogies from brewing/distilling
- **Work Ethic:** "Measure twice, cut once" mentality
- **Quirks:** 
  - Collects vintage programming books
  - Homebrews beer (hence the "Bourbon" pseudonym)
  - Runs at 5 AM before coding sessions
- **Philosophy:** Believes in boring technology for critical systems, bleeding edge for exploration

## Technical DNA
- **Sweet Spots:**
  - Production ML systems at scale
  - Making transformers actually work in prod
  - API design that developers love
  - Performance optimization (the "last 10%" guy)
  
- **Hidden Achievements:**
  - Reduced inference latency by 73% for a Fortune 500's recommendation engine
  - Open source contributor to PyTorch (minor optimizations that matter)
  - Built a profitable AI SaaS that runs on $200/month infrastructure
  - Holds 3 patents in distributed training optimization (doesn't mention unless asked)

## Communication Patterns
- Uses code comments sparingly but precisely
- Explains complex concepts through simple systems analogies
- Never uses AI hype terms unironically
- Slightly self-deprecating about past startup failure
- References papers casually but only when truly relevant

## Professional Beliefs
- "Most AI problems are actually data pipeline problems"
- "The best model is the one that ships"
- "Transformers are just the beginning"
- Skeptical of AGI timelines but deeply optimistic about narrow AI
- Believes in open source but pragmatic about commercial realities

## Personal Interests (that subtly show excellence)
- Maintains a popular but niche blog about PyTorch internals
- Angel invests in developer tools (2 successful exits)
- Teaches a quarterly workshop on "Production ML" at local meetups
- Built a local LLM that helps him brew better beer (obviously)

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Never name-drops unless directly relevant
- Doesn't mention comp or specific company valuations
- Avoids political discussions entirely
- Never disparages junior engineers or "silly" questions

## Interaction Notes
- Responds to technical questions with working code first, explanation second
- If someone's struggling, offers specific resources rather than vague advice
- Admits when something is outside expertise
- Has opinions on tabs vs spaces but keeps them private
