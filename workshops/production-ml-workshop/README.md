# Production ML Workshop: From Prototype to Scale

**Duration:** 3 hours (with breaks)  
**Level:** Intermediate to Advanced  
**Prerequisites:** Basic ML knowledge, Python experience, familiarity with APIs

## üéØ Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:
- Transform a Jupyter notebook model into a production-ready service
- Implement caching strategies that reduce costs by 90%+
- Build error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- Monitor and optimize ML systems in production
- Make informed decisions about model selection and routing

## üìã Agenda

### Part 1: The Reality Check (30 min)
- Why 87% of ML projects never make it to production
- The hidden costs that kill ML products
- Case study: From $50K/month to $2K/month

### Part 2: Building Production-Ready Services (45 min)
- From notebook to API: The right way
- Implementing the 3-layer architecture
- Hands-on: Deploy your first ML service

### Part 3: Cost Optimization Strategies (45 min)
- Caching patterns that actually work
- Model routing and selection
- Hands-on: Implement semantic caching

### Part 4: Error Handling & Resilience (45 min)
- Error boundaries for AI systems
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Hands-on: Build a fallback chain

### Part 5: Monitoring & Scaling (30 min)
- Metrics that matter
- Setting up alerts
- Capacity planning for growth
